#' Capacity targets from two sources
#' @description The capacity targets (GW)  at regional level are produced from two different databases-
#' Rogelj 2017 paper (see readme in inputdata), and REN21 Global Renewables report
#' The Rogelj2017 capacity targets are further broken down to conditional and unconditional targets.
#' @author Aman Malik
#' @param sources Database source
#' @param condition if applicable, conditional or unconditional
