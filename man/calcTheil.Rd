\title{Calculate regional Theil-T index}
\usage{
calcTheil()
}
\value{
magpie objects of unweighted contribution to Theil, weights (= country shares of regional GDP), docstring
}
\description{
To calculate the regional Theil-T index (= correction to welfare function for a lognormal income distribution) we do the following:
(1) convert country-level Gini coefficients to Theil (2) calculate contribution to Theil-T index that includes both between-countries and within-country inequality 
(see e.g. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theil_index). The latter can then be aggregated with calcOutput().
}
\details{
NB 1: the aggregation depends on the region mapping. It is implemented such that the regionmapping specified in getConfig()$regionmapping is used.

NB 2: the result of calcOutput('Theil', aggregate = FALSE), is NOT the country Theil-T, but the unweighted contribution from a given country to the regional value.
